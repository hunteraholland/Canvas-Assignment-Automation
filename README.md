<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project builds the foundation for my school automation projects this year. Starting in 2021, I wanted
to show how important automation is too me. This simple python script is capable of looking at my assignments in Canvas,
and then create a task for each assignment in Google Tasks.



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

In order to use this script for yourself. You will need to take care of a few things on your own.

### Prerequisites

In order to use the Canvas API, you will need to have a authorization token. Information on how to implement authentication
is [here](https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/file.oauth.html).

The Google Tasks API requires OAuth2. For information on how to set up your environment please refer to this
